      <h2>David O'Reilly Basic Animation Aesthetics Response</h2>
  </header>
  <article>
      <p><b>What is the thought was the basic idea from the reading. What is the author's main argument?</b></p>
          <p>In "David O'Reilly's Basic Animation Aesthetics", O'Reilly speaks his mind about how to make a film feel cinematic and trustworthy. Using his own work, "Please Say Something", he supports his claims by demonstrating how humane emotion and truth can be conveyed through something unrealistic when done correctly.</p>
     
          <p>O'Reilly's main argument is believability is achieved through consistency, rather than beauty or realism. He is a strong advocate for strong aesthetics and consistency in animation. He believes that in order to captivate an audience, the aesthetics of a film should "feel" right and stay loyal to pre-established laws. Again, he uses his work to validate staying loyal to established rules such as finding alternate ways to achieve the effect of something and sticking with a particular style of character design.</p>
