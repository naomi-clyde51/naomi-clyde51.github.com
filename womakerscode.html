  <p>On December 4th, I took a trip to Time Square to attend WoMakersCode hosted in Microsoft Reactor New York. When I was there, I met up with former LaGuardia colleagues as well as new ones, along with other aspiring women of technology. The atmosphere was friendly, comfortable, and clean, and the view of Times Square from the meeting room was beautiful.</p>  
  <p>I learned that the organizer of the event, Caridad, is also a E-commerce professor at LaGuardia and passionate about women's movement in the technical field. After a brief PowerPower introduction of WoMakersCode, she interviewed four female representatives in front of us, which I took advantage of by taking notes in my notepad. Topics that were discussed included the benefits of college and bootcamps, how to thrive in the workforce, available resources to hone your skills, leadership attitudes, and even the honest truth of micro-aggression in the workforce. Some concerns that were addressed by the audience, including myself, were the differences between a degree in Software Engineer and Computer Science and defining yourself confidently in the workforce. Afterwards, Caridad and the representatives stayed afterwards to answer more questions one-on-one. It was clear that these women was passionate about their careers and helping others pave a clearer path into the field.</p>      
  <p>Overall, my experience at the WoMakersCode was informative, resourceful, and worth the trip for women who are interested in creating things using modern day technology. I would like to thank Ms. Caridad for taking time to organize this inspiring event and many more in the future.</p>
